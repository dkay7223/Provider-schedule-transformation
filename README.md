### **Summary: Provider Schedule Transformation**

#### **Requirements:**

1. **Input Data:**
   - There is a CSV file named "provider_table.csv" containing provider schedule data.
   - The CSV file includes columns like 'id' and 'scheduled_times' among others.

2. **Code Functionality:**
   - The Python script reads the "provider_table.csv" file using Pandas.
   - It defines a function `calculate_hours` to calculate the duration in hours between start and end times.
   - The main function `transform_provider_data` processes the provider schedule data:
     - Parses the JSON-formatted schedule data in the 'scheduled_times' column.
     - Calculates the total hours available for each provider on each day.
     - Creates a new DataFrame with columns: 'id', 'day', and 'total_hours_available'.
   - The transformed data is printed using `print(availability_df.head())`.
   - Any exceptions during the execution are caught and printed.

3. **Output:**
   - The transformed data is saved into a new CSV file named "provider_availability.csv".
   - The output CSV file includes columns: 'id', 'day', and 'total_hours_available'.

# Folder structure explanation

1. **Code Files:**
    - **`query.py`**: Contains Python code for data transformation.
    - **`queries.sql`**: Likely includes SQL queries related to the assignment.

2. **Data Files:**
    - **`provider_table.csv`**: CSV file containing data about providers.
    - **`provider_availability.csv`**: Output CSV file where you store the transformed data.

3. **Database Files:**
    - **`provider.sql`**: SQL file likely containing the schema and structure for the provider table.
    - **`visit.sql`**: SQL file, possibly related to visits.
    - **`member.sql`**: SQL file, probably related to members.

4. **Excel File:**
    - **`MySQL.xlsx`**: Potentially an Excel file related to MySQL, maybe schema or queries.

5. **Code Functionality:**
    - The Python script reads data from `provider_table.csv`.
    - It transforms the data, calculating total hours available for each provider on different days.
    - The transformed data is stored in `provider_availability.csv`.
    - The script prints the first few rows of the transformed data.
